     * Without Locking (Potential Race Condition)
     *
     * If pessimistic locking is not used, multiple transactions might interact with the counter concurrently without ensuring exclusive access.
     * This could lead to a race condition where the counterâ€™s value becomes inconsistent due to concurrent modifications.
